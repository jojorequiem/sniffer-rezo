# sniffer_rezo

![Banner](assets/screenshots/banner_1.png)

`sniffer_rezo` is a lightweight C-based network packet sniffer designed to run as a background daemon on Linux systems. It captures and logs network traffic in real time, displaying detailed information about IP packets, ports, and protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP).

> üõ†Ô∏è This project was created as a small exercise to learn how to use `fork()`, raw sockets, and how to daemonize a process in C.
